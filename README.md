## Project Description
For this project we will be creating a web application that will allow users to find locations of our restaurant using Google Maps and make reservations. Once the reservation has been confirmed, we will send a confirmation email to you. You can also contact us using our page with any questions you may have.

## Technologies and Services 
For this project we will simply be using Heroku to host our website. The technologies we will use using is strictly HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript for the frontend, Node.js for the server and Mongodb for the database. We will also be using Google Maps API, for the user to search for the closest location.
