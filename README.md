## Project Description
For this project we will be creating a web application that will allow users to search locations of our restaurant using Google Maps and make reservations. Once the reservation has been confirmed, we will give the option for the user to add it to their Google calendar via Google API.

## Technologies and Services 
For this project we will simply be using Heroku to host our website. The technologies we will use using is strictly HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. We will also be using Google's API with Google Calendar and Gmail to sync and add the events to the users account. We will also be using Google Maps API, for the user to search for the closest location.
